        <h2>What is Github?</h2>
        <p>To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people. </p>
        <p>
            GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.</p>

        <h2>How to create a GitHub Repository?</h2>
        <p>A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded. This GitHub repository acts as your remote repository. So let me make your task easy, just follow these simple steps to create a GitHub repository: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the link: <a href="https://github.com/"> https://github.com/ .</a></li>
            <li>Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github”.</li>
            <li>Click on “Start a new project”.</li>
            <li>Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. You can also give a description to your repository (optional)</li>   
        </ul>
        <p>Congratulations, your repository is successfully created!</p>
          </div>
     <!-- operations -->
    <div class="section-operation">
      
        <h2>Operations</h2>
          <!-- Commit -->
        <h3>Commit</h3>
        <p>This operation helps you to save the changes in your file. When you commit a file, you should always provide the message, just to keep in the mind the changes done by you. Though this message is not compulsory but it is always recommended so that it can differentiate the various versions or commits you have done so far to your repository. These commit messages maintain the history of changes which in turn help other contributors to understand the file better. Now let’s make our first commit, follow the below steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on “readme- changes” file which we have just created.</li>
            <li> Click on the “edit” or a pencil icon in the righmost corner of the file.</li>
            <li>Once you click on that, an editor will open where you can type in the changes or anything. </li>
            <li>Write a commit message which identifies your changes.</li>   
            <li>Click commit changes in the end.</li>   
        </ul>
        <p>We have successfully made our first commit. Now this “readme- changes” file is different from the master branch. Next, let us see how can we open a pull request.</p>
        <!-- pull command -->
        <h3>Pull</h3>
        <p>Pull command is the most important command in GitHub. It tell the changes done in the file and request other contributors to view it as well as merge it with the master branch. Once the commit is done, anyone can pull the file and can start a discussion over it. Once its all done, you can merge the file. Pull command compares the changes which are done in the file and if there are any conflicts, you can manually resolve it. Now let us see different steps involved to pull request in GitHub.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the "Pull requests" tab.</li>
            <li> Click "New pull request".</li>
            <li>Once you click on pull request, select the branch and click "readme- changes" file to view changes between the two files present in our repository. </li>
            <li>Click “Create pull request”.</li>   
            <li>Enter any title, description to your changes and click on “Create pull request”.</li>   
        </ul>
          </div>
