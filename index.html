        <h2>What is Github?</h2>
        <p>To be very crisp about what exactly is GitHub, it is a file or code-sharing service to collaborate with different people. </p>
        <p>
            GitHub is a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.</p>

        <h2>How to create a GitHub Repository?</h2>
        <p>A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded. This GitHub repository acts as your remote repository. So let me make your task easy, just follow these simple steps to create a GitHub repository: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the link: <a href="https://github.com/"> https://github.com/ .</a></li>
            <li>Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github”.</li>
            <li>Click on “Start a new project”.</li>
            <li>Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. You can also give a description to your repository (optional)</li>   
        </ul>
        <p>Congratulations, your repository is successfully created!</p>
